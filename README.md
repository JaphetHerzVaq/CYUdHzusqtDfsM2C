# **README: Candidate Recommendation System with Embedding Techniques and Machine Learning Models**

## **Objective**

The goal of this project is to build a recommendation system that ranks candidates based on their similarity to a job query. The system leverages a combination of **vector representation** (embedding) models and advanced **ranking models** to determine which candidates are most relevant for a given job position.

## **Technologies Used**

1. **Word2Vec**:
   **Word2Vec** is a popular **word representation** technique that uses neural networks to learn the semantic relationships between words. This model transforms words into **high-dimensional vectors**, allowing the measurement of similarity between them in a vector space. Word2Vec is used to generate **embeddings** for job titles, enabling the calculation of similarity between job queries and candidate profiles.

2. **GloVe** (Global Vectors for Word Representation):
   **GloVe** is another widely used technique for **word representation** that relies on factorizing word co-occurrence matrices. Unlike Word2Vec, GloVe considers global statistics of the corpus to learn word vectors. Similar to Word2Vec, GloVe transforms words into dense vectors and is used for comparing job titles and job descriptions through **cosine similarity**.

3. **Sentence Transformers**:
   **Sentence Transformers** are pre-trained **Transformer-based models**, such as **BERT** or **RoBERTa**, which generate **embeddings** for sentences or text snippets. Unlike Word2Vec and GloVe, **Sentence Transformers** can capture the context of words within a sentence, making them more accurate for semantic comparison between complete texts, such as job titles and job descriptions.

4. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**:
   **Large Language Models** like **GPT-3** or **Mistral** are capable of understanding and generating natural language text. These models are trained on vast amounts of text and can generate **contextual embeddings**, which are useful for evaluating similarity between job queries and candidate profiles. Moreover, **LLMs** can enhance the recommendation system through **text generation** and **contextual response generation**.

5. **RankNet**:
   **RankNet** is a neural network model specifically designed for **ranking tasks**. This model is used to order candidates based on their similarity to a job query. RankNet adjusts the ranking of candidates by **minimizing the loss function** that evaluates the differences between candidate scores and their preferences.

6. **LambdaRank**:
   **LambdaRank** is an extension of RankNet that optimizes the ranking of documents by minimizing a loss function based on **pairwise differences**. This technique penalizes when the **supervisor signal** is not correctly reflected in the scores, helping to improve the accuracy in ranking candidates based on their characteristics and preferences.

## **System Features**

- **Similarity-based Recommendations**: The system uses techniques like **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **Sentence Transformers** to transform candidate job titles and job queries into vectors. It then calculates the **cosine similarity** between the vectors to determine which candidates are most relevant.

- **Integration of Supervisor Signal**: Recruiters can highlight specific candidates as **starred**, increasing their priority in the ranking even if their similarity score isn't the highest. This feature ensures that human preferences are factored into the final recommendations.

- **Ranking Optimization**: **RankNet** and **LambdaRank** further refine the candidate ranking, taking into account both the calculated similarities and the supervisor signals, ensuring that the most relevant candidates are prioritized.

- **Improved Contextual Similarities**: The use of **Sentence Transformers** and **LLMs** allows the system to better capture the context of job titles and queries, providing more accurate evaluations.

## **Workflow**

1. **Embedding Generation**:
   - Job titles of candidates are transformed into **embeddings** using **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **Sentence Transformers**, depending on the data type and accuracy needed.

2. **Similarity Calculation**:
   - The similarity between candidate embeddings and the job query is calculated using **cosine similarity** to determine how well candidates match the job requirements.

3. **Supervisor Signal Application**:
   - Recruiters can mark certain candidates as **starred**, which increases their priority in the ranking, even if their similarity score is lower.

4. **Ranking Optimization**:
   - **RankNet** and **LambdaRank** further adjust the ranking of candidates, improving the recommendations by considering both the generated embeddings and the supervisor signals.

## **Benefits**

- **Accurate Recommendations**: The combined use of embeddings from different models (Word2Vec, GloVe, Sentence Transformers, LLMs) ensures highly relevant recommendations by considering both context and direct similarities.
  
- **Flexibility**: The system adapts to recruiter preferences with the **supervisor signal**, enabling highly customized recommendations.

- **Continuous Optimization**: Through **RankNet** and **LambdaRank**, the system can continuously adjust and improve the ranking as more data and supervisor signals are received.

## **Conclusion**

This recommendation system provides an advanced solution for ranking candidates based on their similarity to a job query. By integrating **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, **Sentence Transformers**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, along with advanced ranking techniques such as **RankNet** and **LambdaRank**, the system ensures that recruiters receive the best possible recommendations. The ability to incorporate supervisor signals makes the system even more powerful and flexible, adapting to real-world hiring needs.
